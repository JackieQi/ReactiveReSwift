 A Reducer that combines multiple reducers into one. You will typically use this reducer during
 initial store setup:
 
 ```swift
 let reducer = ObservableCombinedReducer([IncreaseByOneReducer(), IncreaseByTwoReducer()])
 ObservableStore(reducer: reducer, 
                stateType: CounterState.self, 
                observable: ObservableProperty(CounterState()))
 ```
 
 The order of the reducers in the array is the order in which the reducers will be invoked.
